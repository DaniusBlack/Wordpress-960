This theme is designed to integrate the 960 grid system design principles into WordPress site design and maintenance.

This theme is currently limited to 960px width divided into 24 columns with 5 pixel margins on each column.
I hope to increase the flexibility by taking advantage of the fluid width abilities of the 960 framework and adding a width option to the theme options screen.
